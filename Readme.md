## Project Overview
This project is a **console-based Python quiz application** developed as part of the **COM4402 Programming module (A2: Implementation)**.

The application presents multiple-choice questions to the user, validates input, handles invalid entries safely, calculates the score accurately, and displays the final result upon completion. The program is designed to demonstrate core Python programming concepts such as control flow, functions, data structures, and input validation.
